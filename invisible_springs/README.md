## Invisble Springs 

This project is an example of creating a proportional controller with the iRobot™ Education's Create®3 Robot.

The goal of the script is to have one robot maintain a set distance from the robot driving in front of it using the IR sensors. Typically a proportional controller
follows the format of P = P0 + error*Kp.
