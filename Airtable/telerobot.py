Tufts Create®3 Educational Robot Example

In this example we will use airtable to remotely control the Create®3.

        Here we are declaring how we want the Node to publish a message. 
        We've imported Twist from geometry messages which is the type of message we will send over the topic '/cmd_vel' with a queue size of 10.
        Queue size is a quality of service setting that limiits amount of queued messages.
        Basically, we are determining what type of data we want to publish.
