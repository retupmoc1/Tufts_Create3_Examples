## Jupyter Notebook Examples

The beauty of a Juypter Notebook is that it simplifies the coding process by bypassing the compiling, building, package hastle. Don't worry you will get to that later.

These scripts are meant to teach the basics of subscribing, publishing and sending actions which are all the necessary commands to control the iRobot™ Education's Create®3 Educational Robot.

## Get Started
0. Download and unzip the repository as previously [directed](https://github.com/brianabouchard/Tufts_Create3_Examples/blob/main/README.md). 

1. Install pip on your machine:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
2. Install Jupyter Notebook in Terminal:
```
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```
```
sudo apt install jupyter-core
```
3. In terminal, navigate from your home directory to this directory. 
```
cd Tufts_Create3_Examples-main/Jupyter_Notebook
```
4. Open the files in a browser with the following command. If the web browser does not automatically populate, click the provided link. 
```
jupyter notebook
``` 
5. In the browser page, click on a script you wish to run. 
6. Change the [Namepsace] in the file to match the namespace of your Create® 3 robot.
7. Click on the cell so that it is highlighted in blue & press the run button (toolbar at the top) to run the script. 
8. To close the notebook, go back to terminal & type ctrl+c (pc) or cmd+c (mac). It will ask you to confirm you want to exit the notebook. Click "y" to exit.

For descriptions of what each script will do, check out the comments in the code. 

Write your own code by adding a cell at the bottom of any file, typing out your code, selecting the cell so that it turns blue, and pressing the run button.
