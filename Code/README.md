# Tufts_Create3_Examples Code

Welcome, again! In this folder we've put together sample code to help you learn to control iRobot™ Education's Create®3 Robot. These code examples will you build 
your programming skills from the basic Python Web Playground through ROS 2 package compilation. 

The ideal progression is to start with the Python_Playground folder, move to the Jupyter_Notebook folder, and then to the Package folder. 

**Check out each folder to see what the scrips do and for getting started instructions.**
