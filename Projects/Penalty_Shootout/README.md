# iRobot™ Education's Create® 3 Robot is the new Alex Morgan, Mo Salah or Edouard Mendy. 

Design soccer players (that will sit on top of your Create® 3 robot) to shoot a penalty kick or save one and code your Create® 3 robot to fake out the opponent. We used a ping pong ball in place of a soccer ball but get creative with your choice of sports equipment. 

Rules for the shootout are as follow: 
1. Goalkeepers can only move side to side. 
2. Shooters must shoot before a taped line.
3. Both teams must press run on their code at the same time. 
4. The ball must be in your contraption before your start the code. 
5. No teleop. 

## Get Started

0. Download and unzip the repository as previously [directed](https://github.com/brianabouchard/Tufts_Create3_Examples/blob/main/README.md).

**Either use the Jupyter file**
1. Install Jupyter Notebooks as explained in the [Code](https://github.com/brianabouchard/Tufts_Create3_Examples/blob/main/Code/Jupyter_Notebook/README.md) folder.

2. Navigate from your home directory to this directory 
```
cd Tufts_Create3_Examples-main/Projects/Penalty_Shootout
```
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook browser
```
jupyter notebook
```
4. Select the penalty_kick.ipynb file and edit the namespace to match your robot's namespace
5. Highligh the code cell so that it turns blue and press run

**Or use the python file**
1. Navigate from your home directory to this directory 
```
cd Tufts_Create3_Examples-main/Projects/Penalty_Shootout
```
2. Edit the namespace in the file to match your robot's namespace
3. Run the script with 
```
python3 penalty_kick.py
```
