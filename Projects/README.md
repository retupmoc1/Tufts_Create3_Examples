# Tufts_Create3_Examples Projects

Welcome, again! In this folder we've put together some sample projects that can be built with iRobot™ Education's Create®3 Robot, building materials of your choice 
and some miscellaneous electronics components. 

These projects have more complex coding requirements, at least a small building component, and a larger goal that the robot must accomplish. The projects
build on each other to culminate in a final joust to the death!

**Check out each folder for demo videos, example code, and getting started instructions.**
